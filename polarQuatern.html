                          are not fully exploited yet in the

                          the polarization optical systems is given.
                          This is the most compact, adequate and elegant
                          calculus corresponding to the well-known

                          and their interaction with the polarization
                          devices on the Poincaré sphere. In this first
                          paper, we deduce the Pauli algebraic vectorial
                          forms of the operators corresponding to the

                          devices and to all the states of light
                          polarization. In the next paper we shall give
                          the vectorial Pauli algebraic analysis of the
                          interaction between the whole hierarchy of

                      <h2><font size="2">The geometric algebra of
                          three-dimensional space (the ``Pauli
                          algebra'') is known to provide an efficient
                          geometric description of electromagnetic
                          phenomena. Here, it is applied to the
                          three-dimensional Stokes subspace to describe
                          the polarization of an approximately
                          monochromatic collimated beam of
                          electromagnetic radiation. The coherency
                          density ρ is a real element of the algebra
                          whose components are the four Stokes
                          parameters: a scalar representing the total
                          photon flux density plus a three-dimensional
                          vector whose direction and length in the
                          Poincaré sphere give the type and degree of
                          polarization. The detection of the radiation
                          and the incoherent and coherent modification
                          of the polarization by various optical
                          elements are calculated by algebraic
                          multiplication which has faithful
                          representations in 2×2 matrices. One matrix
                          representation of ρ is the coherency matrix
                          with which Jones and Mueller matrices are
                          related whereas another representation is the
                          spin density matrix. However, the calculations
                          are simplest to perform and interpret in the
                          algebraic form independent of any particular
                          matrix representation. It is shown that any
                          possible change in the Stokes parameters can
                          be treated algebraically by a combination of
                          attenuation, depolarization, polarization, and
                          rotation transformations of ρ. The geometric
                          algebra thus unifies Stokes parameters, the
                          Poincaré sphere, Jones and Mueller matrices,
                          and the coherency and density matrices in a
                          single, simple formalism.</font></h2>

                      <div>As discussed below, Bell's inequalities and
                        experimental results rule out commutative hidden
                        variable models as a basis for Bell
                        correlations, but not necessarily
                        non-commutative probability models. A local
                        probability model is constructed for Bell
                        correlations based on non-commutative operations
                        involving polarizers. As in the entanglement
                        model, the Bell correlation is obtained from a
                        probability calculus without explicit use of
                        deterministic hidden variables. The probability
                        calculus used is associated with chaotic light.
                        Joint wave intensity correlations at spatially
                        separated polarization analyzers are computed
                        using common information originating at the
                        source. When interpreted as photon count rates,
                        these yield quantum mechanical joint
                        probabilities after the contribution of
                        indeterminate numbers of photon pairs greater
                        than one is subtracted out. The formalism
                        appears to give a local account of Bell
                        correlations. <a

                    <div><strong>Polarization and birefringence are two
                        of those quasi-obscure technical words derived
                        from physical optics. &nbsp;Quantum physics
                        tells us that a beam of light is a stream of
                        photons, but at the same time it is a travelling
                        wave made of oscillating electric and magnetic
                        fields vibrating at right angles to the
                        direction of wave motion and to each other.
                        &nbsp;The light is said to be linearly polarized
                        if the electric field always vibrates in the
                        same plane, and we call that its plane of
                        polarization. (Light can also be circularly
                        polarized, elliptically polarized, or
                        unpolarized, but we will ignore those
                        complications for the present discussion.)</strong></div>
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <div><strong>Birefringence refers to a special
                        property of some transparent crystals within
                        which the speed of a light beam passing through
                        depends on the direction of polarization and on
                        the direction of motion with respect to the axes
                        of the crystal structure. &nbsp;Solid materials
                        have atoms in their interiors containing lots of
                        positive and negative electric charges.
                        &nbsp;Because of all the possible electrical
                        interactions, such materials should, in
                        principle, stop a light beam dead in its tracks.
                        &nbsp;However, some insulating solid materials
                        like glass and crystals are transparent to light
                        because the electrons they contain are bound
                        (not free to move around and conduct
                        electricity). &nbsp;As light passes by, these
                        bound electrons are pushed-on by the passing
                        electric field and vibrate like tiny
                        masses-on-springs in time with the wave
                        frequency. &nbsp;The coherent motion of these
                        electrons, all vibrating together, captures and
                        then re-emits the light energy, forming a sort
                        of bucket-brigade transmission of the light
                        through the material. &nbsp;In this process the
                        speed of light is slowed to less than c (its
                        velocity in vacuum), but the light is passed
                        through the material without significant
                        absorption. &nbsp;In glass this slowing of light
                        makes possible refractive devices like lenses
                        and prisms.</strong></div>
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <div><strong>Crystals have an organized structure
                        made of repeating arrangements of atoms.
                        &nbsp;Polarized light passing through such
                        crystals in one direction may encounter more
                        tightly bound electrons (with different
                        vibration properties) from the electrons more
                        loosely bound in a perpendicular direction.
                        &nbsp;This situation, which is called
                        birefringence, has the result that polarized
                        light travels faster in one crystal axis
                        direction than in another. &nbsp;With another
                        polarization direction of the light, this
                        speed-difference effect may be changed because
                        the electric driving force on the bound
                        electrons is in its plane of polarization, the
                        direction of the light's electric field.
                        &nbsp;Thus, light interacting with crystals
                        produces complicated, interesting, and useful
                        behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal may split an
                        incoming light beam into two different beams
                        that travel with different speeds in different
                        directions.</strong></div>
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <div><strong>The best-known example of birefringence
                        is the polarized double images that are seen
                        when a printed page is viewed through a
                        transparent crystal of calcite. &nbsp;In the
                        optics laboratory birefringence is very useful,
                        because it can be used to split a light beam
                        into two separate beams with complementary
                        polarizations. It can also be used to rotate the
                        plane of polarization of a light beam or to
                        change linear polarization to and from circular

                      <div>The quaternion method is introduced into the
                        polarization optics systematically. Two
                        quaternion representations of polarized light
                        are presented which are based on the Poincare
                        sphere representation and the Stokes parameters,
                        respectively, and their equivalence relation is
                        proved. The diversity of the quaternion
                        representations of the polarized light is
                        discussed. The quaternion representations of
                        polarizing devices and systems are obtained. By
                        using the quaternion representation, the
                        equivalent theorem of polarizing system is
                        proved, and the composition and the quaternion
                        representations of the reduced equivalent system
                        are deduced. The quaternion matrix calculation
                        method for polarizing systems is presented, and
                        the transform relations between the quaternion
                        representations and the Mueller matrixes are
                        obtained. Based on the conditional commutative
                        low of the quaternion matrix multiplication, the
                        optimization way of the quaternion matrix
                        calculation method are discussed, and the
                        application prospects of the algorithm are
                        pointed.</div>

                    <div>Some efforts have been made to extend
                      real-valued neural networks to other number
                      fields. Complex-valued neural networks have been
                      built and proved to have advantage on
                      generalization ability [15] and can be more easily
                      optimized [26].</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;For our QCNNs, one pixel is a
                      quaternion or a 3D vector in color space, but the
                      proposed convolution find its best representation
                      in a small part of the color space because we
                      restrict the convolution to apply only a rotate
                      and a scaling transform. Such a convolution
                      actually impose implicit regularizers on the model
                      such that &nbsp;we can suppress the risk of
                      over-fitting brought by too many degrees of
                      freedom to the learning of kernels., &nbsp;</div>
                    <div>Additionally, in real-valued CNNs, the input
                      layer transfers 3-channel images to single-channel
                      feature maps, ignoring the interrelationship among
                      channels, which causes information loss. Although
                      the loss can be recovered with multiple different
                      filters, the recovery requires redundant
                      iterations, and there’s no guarantee that the loss
                      can be recovered perfectly. In QCNNs, the
                      convolution causes no order reduction in the input
                      layer, thus the information of interrelationship
                      among channels can be fully conserved.</div>

                      <h3><font size="2">Quaternion neural networks are
                          models in which computations of the neurons
                          are based on quaternions, the four-dimensional
                          equivalents of imaginary numbers. This paper
                          shows by experiments that the
                          quaternion-version of the Back Propagation
                          (BP) algorithm achieves correct geometrical
                          transformations in three-dimensional space, as
                          well as in color space for an image
                          compression problem, whereas real-valued BP
                          algorithms fail. The quaternion neural network
                          also performs superior in terms of convergence
                          speed to a real-valued neural network with
                          respect to the 3-bit parity check problem, as
                          simulations show.</font></h3>
